## Description
This application allows users to manage company's departments and employees through command line in the Node by iterating through options like view/add/delete departments or employee's positions, view/add/delete/update employees or thier roles. Everything is displayed in multiple tables that are stored in a database and seeded using SQL programming language. <br>

## Installation
To run this application, the user will need to install Node.js, and after that initialize the folder containing the application by typing `npm init -y` in the command line. The `package.json` will hold various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as how to handle the project's dependencies. Then the user can install  all of the required dependencies by typing `npm i`. The project was build with JavaScript and SQL programming languages. To successfully manage the employees and the whole system, the user has to run the SQL script `schema.sql` located in the `db` folder in the root directory.

```
npm init -y 
npm i
```

## Usage 

The user can invoke this application by opening the app.js file in the Node command line by typing `node app.js`. Then the user will be prompted with a series of questions about how he would like to manipulate the data: view/add/remove departments, view/add/remove roles, view/add/remove/update employees. <br>
Viewing options will display tables Departments(with columns `id, name`), Roles(with columns `id, title, salary, department_id`), Employees(with columns `id, first&last name, role_id, manager_id`). After choosing an option to add employee/role/department the user will be prompted with a series of questions to gather the info to add it to the table. Everytime the user will choose to add an employee, role or department a row containing the info will appear at the bottom of the chosen table. When the option `update` is chosen, the user will see a list of the options(employees) that can be updated. After every option the user will be presented with the main menu every single time until the option `Exit the application` is chosen.
